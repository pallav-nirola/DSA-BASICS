//We create an array freq[256] to count how many times each character appears.

Since there are 256 possible ASCII characters, we use an array of size 256 to cover the entire ASCII range.

The index of the array represents the ASCII value of a character, and the value at that index is the frequency of that character in the string.

Counting Frequencies:

The for loop goes through each character of the input string.

For each character c, we use freq[c]++ to increment the frequency of that character. This works because the ASCII value of a character can be used as an index in the freq array.

Displaying Frequencies:

We loop through the freq array from index 0 to 255.

If a character appears at least once (i.e., freq[i] > 0), we print that character and its frequency.

We use (char)i to print the character corresponding to the ASCII value stored at index i.

Edge Case:

If no characters are repeated, each character will still be counted, but only those with a frequency greater than 0 will be printed.
